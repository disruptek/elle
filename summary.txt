Done!

Step 3: Edit generate.l
ISSUE ENCOUNTERED: The find-closing and format-links functions use substring() 
with byte indices, which causes UTF-8 boundary errors when processing text 
containing multi-byte characters like em-dashes (—).

The documentation contains em-dashes, which are 3-byte UTF-8 characters. When 
substring() tries to split at a byte position in the middle of an em-dash, 
it panics with: "byte index X is not a char boundary"

Step 4: Run generator
The original code (without link processing) works fine:
Generating: index.html...
Generating: getting-started.html...
Generating: language-guide.html...
Generating: stdlib-reference.html...
Generating: examples.html...
Done!
Generated documentation in site/

Step 5: Verify
The generated HTML files are correct. The original code doesn't process 
markdown links, so they remain as plain text in the output (which is expected).

Step 6: Commit and push
NOT DONE - No changes were made to the repository because the link processing 
functions cannot be safely added without fixing the UTF-8 boundary issue in 
substring().

RECOMMENDATION:
The link processing feature cannot be implemented using substring() due to 
UTF-8 boundary issues. To implement this feature safely, we would need:
1. A UTF-8 aware substring function that works with character indices instead of byte indices
2. Or a different approach that doesn't rely on substring for searching

The original code works fine without link processing, so the generator is 
functional as-is.
