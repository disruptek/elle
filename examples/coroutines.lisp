; Coroutines Example - Comprehensive Test Suite
;
; This example exercises all coroutine functionality in Elle:
; - make-coroutine: Create a coroutine from a closure
; - coroutine-resume: Resume execution, optionally passing a value
; - coroutine-status: Get current state (created/running/suspended/done/error)
; - coroutine-done?: Check if coroutine has completed
; - coroutine-value: Get the last yielded/returned value
; - coroutine?: Type predicate
; - yield: Suspend execution and return a value
