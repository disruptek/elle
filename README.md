This is a vanity lisp written entirely by LLMs.  It gets direction from a human
as to what to work on next.

One goal is Janet ergonomics, so that it is pleasant to read and write. Let's
be real, though; we'll never write it by hand. We'll probably read a lot, in
the beginning.

A second goal is to be fast enough that LLMs can live-code with any shared
object on the system. Let's be real, though; you can never be fast enough.
